Code Academy Computer Science 101 project

Objective: Create a terminal game

Selection: tic-tac-toe

Brainstorming:
Have the user play against the computer
ask if you want to be selected X or O
whomever is X goes first
After 1 player plays 3 times, start checking to see if someone is winning
There are 9 spaces and 8 ways to win.

End result:
Player is always X.
Tic-tac-toe that relies on an input confirmation to determine who won.

Present issues that can be fixed:
What if an interger isn't chosen?
What if all 9 slots are taken and there is no winner?
Do we care if the player lies and claims they won?
